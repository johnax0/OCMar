For those who are new, we will start with Sandbox or VMWare. Sandbox/VMWare needed to be used to prevent the malware from activating and running on the host (your main computer), therefore the activity and the length of what malware can do is or at least limited.
To install VMWare, you can go here https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html and download the file needed.
